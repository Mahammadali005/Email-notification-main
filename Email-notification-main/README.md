#  Email_Notification

As a **Cloud Engineer**, I built a **serverless event-driven email notification system** using **AWS S3, SNS, Lambda, IAM, and CloudWatch**.  
This system automatically sends an email notification whenever a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket.

##  Workflow

### 1. File Upload to S3
A file is uploaded to an **S3 bucket**, which triggers the workflow.

### 2. SNS Notification
The S3 event is configured to publish to an **Amazon SNS Topic**, which handles the delivery of notifications.

### 3. IAM Role & Permissions
A dedicated **IAM Role** was created for the Lambda function with the following managed policies:
- `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
- `AWSLambda_FullAccess`
- `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`

### 4. Lambda Function Execution
The **Lambda function** is triggered when a new file is uploaded.  
It processes the event and sends details to the SNS topic.

### 5. Email Notification
The subscribed email address receives structured alerts with file details (name, size, timestamp, bucket).
